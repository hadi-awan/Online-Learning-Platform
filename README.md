# Online-Learning-Platform<br/>
An advanced online learning platform designed to provide users with a seamless experience for enrolling in and managing courses. This platform allows instructors to create and upload course content, while students can browse, enroll, and track their progress in various courses.

## Key Features:<br/>
• **User Authentication and Role Management:** Secure login and registration with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.<br/>
• **Course Management:** Instructors can create, update, and delete courses, including uploading multimedia content.<br/>
• **Student Enrollment:** Students can browse and enroll in courses, track their progress, and access course materials.<br/>
• **RESTful APIs:** Backend services are exposed via RESTful APIs, enabling smooth communication between the frontend and backend.<br/>
• **Microservices Architecture:** Modular design with Spring Cloud Eureka and Spring Cloud Gateway for service discovery and routing.<br/>
• **Payment Integration:** Support for paid courses with secure payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).<br/>
• **Notifications:** Asynchronous notifications for course updates and announcements using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).<br/>
• **Responsive UI:** User-friendly and responsive design using React.js/Angular/Vue.js.<br/><br/>

## Technologies Used:<br/>
• **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, JDBC, REST APIs, Microservices<br/>
• **Frontend:** React.js/Angular/Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br/>
• **Database:** Oracle<br/>
• **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins (CI/CD)<br/>
• **Other Tools:** Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation, Git for version control<br/><br/>

This project serves as a demonstration of comprehensive full-stack development, covering essential aspects of modern software engineering, including data structures, algorithms, and microservices.
